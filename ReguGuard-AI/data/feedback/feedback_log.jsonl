Data Integrity Control Strengthening\n+Observed Gap: The SOP instructs QA to use red pen for checks but does not explicitly define ALCOA+ data integrity principles, correction controls, or backdating prohibition.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+All documentation review and corrections shall comply with ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available). Any correction must be made with a single-line strike-through, signed, dated, and justified. Backdating or overwriting is strictly prohibited.\n+2. Documentation Error Flagging Control\n+Observed Gap: Errors are flagged using temporary notes, which may not ensure permanent traceability.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+Documentation discrepancies shall be recorded directly on the Batch Documentation Checklist or within an electronic deviation tracking system to ensure permanent traceability. Temporary adhesive notes shall not be used for GMP record control.\n+3. OOS Handling Clarification\n+Observed Gap: The SOP states that no test result is out of specification but does not explicitly reference formal OOS investigation procedures.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+Any Out-of-Specification (OOS), Out-of-Trend (OOT), or atypical result must be investigated according to the applicable investigation SOP prior to batch disposition. Batch release shall not proceed until QA approval of investigation closure.\n+4. Electronic Records & E-Signatures Compliance\n+Observed Gap: No reference to electronic records compliance such as 21 CFR Part 11 or EU GMP Annex 11.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+Where electronic systems are used for batch documentation review, they must comply with 21 CFR Part 11 and EU GMP Annex 11 requirements, including audit trails, access control, system validation, and secure electronic signatures.\n+5. Risk-Based Review Approach\n+Observed Gap: The checklist review process is procedural but does not reference Quality Risk Management principles.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+QA review shall apply a risk-based approach in accordance with ICH Q9. Critical process parameters, critical quality attributes, deviations, and reconciliation discrepancies shall receive enhanced scrutiny prior to release.\n+6. Trending & Continuous Improvement\n+Observed Gap: Deviation follow-up is mentioned but no requirement for periodic trending analysis.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+QA shall periodically trend documentation errors, deviations, reconciliation discrepancies, and OOS occurrences to identify systemic risks and implement preventive actions.\n+7. Clear Batch Disposition Authority\n+Observed Gap: Batch release is assigned to Authorised QA Person but role independence is not explicitly strengthened.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+Only a formally appointed Authorized Person independent of Production shall certify batch release after verifying full GMP compliance.\n+8. Rework Control Strengthening\n+Observed Gap: Rework is referenced but does not require documented risk and regulatory impact assessment.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+Reworked batches shall undergo documented risk assessment, stability impact evaluation, and regulatory impact assessment prior to approval for release.\n+Final Assessment\n+After implementation of the above upgrades, the SOP will be aligned with EU GMP, US FDA 21 CFR Part 211, Data Integrity (ALCOA+) principles, ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management, and electronic record compliance requirements. The document will be inspection-ready, audit-defensible, and aligned with modern regulatory expectations."}

Data Integrity Control Strengthening\n+Observed Gap: The SOP instructs QA to use red pen for checks but does not explicitly define ALCOA+ data integrity principles, correction controls, or backdating prohibition.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+All documentation review and corrections shall comply with ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available). Any correction must be made with a single-line strike-through, signed, dated, and justified. Backdating or overwriting is strictly prohibited.\n+2. Documentation Error Flagging Control\n+Observed Gap: Errors are flagged using temporary notes, which may not ensure permanent traceability.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+Documentation discrepancies shall be recorded directly on the Batch Documentation Checklist or within an electronic deviation tracking system to ensure permanent traceability. Temporary adhesive notes shall not be used for GMP record control.\n+3. OOS Handling Clarification\n+Observed Gap: The SOP states that no test result is out of specification but does not explicitly reference formal OOS investigation procedures.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+Any Out-of-Specification (OOS), Out-of-Trend (OOT), or atypical result must be investigated according to the applicable investigation SOP prior to batch disposition. Batch release shall not proceed until QA approval of investigation closure.\n+4. Electronic Records & E-Signatures Compliance\n+Observed Gap: No reference to electronic records compliance such as 21 CFR Part 11 or EU GMP Annex 11.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+Where electronic systems are used for batch documentation review, they must comply with 21 CFR Part 11 and EU GMP Annex 11 requirements, including audit trails, access control, system validation, and secure electronic signatures.\n+5. Risk-Based Review Approach\n+Observed Gap: The checklist review process is procedural but does not reference Quality Risk Management principles.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+QA review shall apply a risk-based approach in accordance with ICH Q9. Critical process parameters, critical quality attributes, deviations, and reconciliation discrepancies shall receive enhanced scrutiny prior to release.\n+6. Trending & Continuous Improvement\n+Observed Gap: Deviation follow-up is mentioned but no requirement for periodic trending analysis.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+QA shall periodically trend documentation errors, deviations, reconciliation discrepancies, and OOS occurrences to identify systemic risks and implement preventive actions.\n+7. Clear Batch Disposition Authority\n+Observed Gap: Batch release is assigned to Authorised QA Person but role independence is not explicitly strengthened.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+Only a formally appointed Authorized Person independent of Production shall certify batch release after verifying full GMP compliance.\n+8. Rework Control Strengthening\n+Observed Gap: Rework is referenced but does not require documented risk and regulatory impact assessment.\n+\n+Compliance Upgrade:\n+Reworked batches shall undergo documented risk assessment, stability impact evaluation, and regulatory impact assessment prior to approval for release.\n+Final Assessment\n+After implementation of the above upgrades, the SOP will be aligned with EU GMP, US FDA 21 CFR Part 211, Data Integrity (ALCOA+) principles, ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management, and electronic record compliance requirements. The document will be inspection-ready, audit-defensible, and aligned with modern regulatory expectations."}
