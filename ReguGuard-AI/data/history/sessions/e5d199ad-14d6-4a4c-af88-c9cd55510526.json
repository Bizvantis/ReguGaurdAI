Batch documentation should be received within 24 hours of completion of packing. \n4. Receiving/Collecting of Batch Documents \n4.1. Batch Documents are delivered by production to the designated Batch Document office for \neach process area and are placed in the incoming tray labelled \u201cCompleted Batch \nDocuments\u201d.   Batch Documents are logged into the Batch Documentation Logbook, \n(Form-150 ) by production staff and must be signed and dated as logged out by the QA Staff \nbefore QA evaluation.    \n4.2. Batch Documentation is to be evaluated by the authorised QA Staff in the Batch \nDocumentation office.   Any Batch Documentation errors found are to be flagged by a Post-it \nnote and placed into the Process Manager\u2019s Red incoming tray labelled \u201cCorrections\u201d.   \nProcess managers are responsible for checking the correction trays daily to ensure prompt resolution of errors. NOTE: The use of \u2018Post-it\u2019 notes is restricted to the flagging of an error, there is to be \nno GMP information recorded onto the post-it note.   The \u2018Post-it\u2019 note is to be \nremoved only by the QA Staff evaluating the batch documentation. \n4.3. Once the Batch Documentation error has been corrected, the Batch Documents are placed \nby production into the Green incoming tray labelled \u201cCorrected Batch Documents\u201d for \ncollection by the QA Staff.   The QA staff will sign and date the Batch Documentation \nLogbook prior to removal from the office. \n5. Evaluation of Batch Documents \n5.1. Batch Documents are checked against the appropriate \u201cBatch Documentation Checklist\u201d \n(Form-555 ) (see SOP QMS-085 ).   This checklist is printed by production and delivered with \nthe Batch Documents. \nNOTE: Use RED pen to perform all QA checks on the \u201cBatch Documentation \nChecklist\u201d Form. \n5.2. Check that Section 1 of the form is correctly filled up. Each document listed on section 2 of the checklist has been received and that all relevant paperwork is of the same BPN and the \nsame manufacturing Material Code.   Write \u201cN/A\u201d on page 1 next to any documents not \napplicable to the BPN. Check any additional forms are attached with the MI sheet. \n5.3. Consult any SOPs listed above to ensure target limit results have been attained. \n5.4. Each page of each document received must be evaluated for accuracy and completion. \n5.5. Any issues with documentation that is less than the criteria listed below should be actioned \nas detailed in Section 4 above. \n5.5.1. A DR (See SOP QMS-035) must be raised if any of the following are noted \nduring evaluation of Batch Documents: \n5.5.1.1. Critical entries have been left blank, e.g. missing signature on Line \nClearance. \n5.5.1.2. Excessive, (i.e. greater than 5) non-critical entries are missing. \n(A production operator may correct non-critical entries, e.g. missing one tick, \nwithout raising a DR.) \n5.5.1.3. An entry is recorded incorrectly and not corrected, e.g. incorrect date. \n5.5.1.4. Documents indicate there has been an absence of due care, e.g. illegible \nentries; multiple (greater than 5) entries marked as corrected by operators.\nStandard Operating Procedure      \nTitle: Evaluation of Batch Documentation and Release for Sale \n______________________________________________________________________________________ \nCopyright\u00a9www.gmpsop.com .

Authorised QA Person responsible for batch release for sale will ensure the following before \na batch is released for sale: \n9.1.1. Batch documents (completed MI Sheet, Forms and Records) are correctly checked \nfor completeness and consistency. \n9.1.2. All in-process and finished product testing were done according to Finished Product Specifications and Test Report. \n9.1.3. Stability samples are taken according to stability program. Retention samples are correctly checked and managed. \n9.1.4. Batch documentation checklist ( Form-555 ) is correctly checked, filled up and signed \nby both authorised production staff and QA Staff. \n9.1.5. QA Inspection Sheet (Form-565 ) is correctly filled up, signed and no data has \ninconsistency or no test result is out of specification. \n9.2. \n9.3. \n9.4. \n9.5. 9.1.6. All Deviation Reports ( Form-450 ) raised were successfully completed, corrective \nactions are implemented and preventative actions are listed. \nIf all the actions are meeting the in-house and regulatory requirements, the Authorised QA \nPerson will sign the Batch Document Checklist to release the batch. \nAuthorised QA Person will produce appropriate number of RELEASED stickers, sign and \nsend those to warehouse to labelled the pallets in Quarantine. \nFor any unsuccessful inspection or non conformance authorised QA Person will hold the \nbatch before the non-conformance is investigated (See SOP QMS-125 ) and the assignable \ncause will be determined. \nFor any critical or serious defect or non-conformance authorised QA Person will reject the \nbatch by stamping a RED reject stamp on the checklist and sign the form. Appropriate number of reject stickers will be produced and signed and send to warehouse to stick those \nonto the rejected pallets. \n10. Rework \n10.1. If a BPN is reworked, see SOP QMS-065 and ensure the following is received: \nForm-380 should be filled out by production and sent with relevant Batch Documentation again for evaluation and consequent release of the batch. \n11.
