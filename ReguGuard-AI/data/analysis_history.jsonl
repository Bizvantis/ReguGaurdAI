We do this by preserving \n& promoting reasonable—and consistent—\nliability protections and content regulation.\nWe are constantly working towards these \ngoals, introducing new policy changes to \nsupport online safety, developing our team  \nof safety policy experts, and continuing to \ninvest in technology to help us tackle illegal \nand harmful content at scale. Content regulation is not a singular end state; \nit will develop and evolve to constantly meet \nthe rapidly changing technology sector.  \nSelf-regulatory approaches, codes of \nconduct, industry-led efforts, and other \ncollaborative fora remain important to \ninnovating and working together on  \nshared content challenges. \n1\nOur guiding principles\nWe take our responsibility seriously, and \nwork to build greater trust with our users, \ngovernments, and society. We regularly share \ninformation about the actions we take to keep \nour users safe online, and work closely with \npolicymakers to ensure new approaches to \ncontent regulation enable the growth of the \ninternet and protect the human rights of its \nmany users.   \nWe believe that new regulation should \nbe designed with safeguards built in and \nprotections of human rights front and center. \nThis includes the well-established principles \nof limited liability for intermediaries and rules \nthat do not restrict legal speech, or have the \neffect of restricting legal speech. Regulation \nshould remain proportionate, risk-based, \nevidence-based, and provide clarity for all \nstakeholders about their responsibilities.Our approach is guided by a clear set  \nof principles:\nShared responsibility\nTackling illegal content is a societal \nchallenge—in which companies, governments, \ncivil society, and users all have a role to \nplay. Where oversight is handled by courts \nor regulators, it is important that they be \nindependent and respect rule of law. \nProtection of fundamental rights\nIt is especially important to ensure that \nlegal frameworks safeguard human rights, \nincluding the right to receive and impart \nlawful speech.\nRule of law and legal clarity\nIt’s important to clearly define what platforms \ncan do to fulfill their legal responsibilities, \nincluding removal obligations. This clarity \nalso helps ensure that those with oversight \nobligations, such as independent regulators, \ncan fulfill their responsibilities.\nProportionality and flexibility to \naccommodate new technology  \nObligations should be proportionate and \nevidence-based. They should be written in \nways that address the underlying issue rather \nthan focusing on existing technologies or \nmandating specific technological fixes. \n2\nThree focus areas of regulation\nAt Google, we haven’t waited for new \ncontent regulation before acting to keep our \nusers safe. We are constantly improving our \ncontent moderation systems and investing \nin technology to help us tackle illegal and \nharmful content at scale. \nWe want to bring our expertise and \nexperiences to debates on content regulation, \nincluding on three focus areas: intermediary \nliability, due diligence, and oversight. We hope \nour contributions can help keep users safe \nfrom bad actors while protecting the core \nbenefits of online environments, including \nthe ability of users to express lawful speech \nopenly, access useful information, and \nconnect with one another.\nIntermediary liability protections\nOnline intermediary services have enabled \nthe free flow of information, educational \nopportunities, media pluralism, culture, \ncreativity, and economic growth. These \nbenefits were made possible by broad liability \nprotections, alongside Good Samaritan \nprotections that help responsible companies \ntake additional content safety measures. A \nrecent study found that undermining internet \nintermediation can lead to a measurable \nimpact on innovation, investment, and \nfreedom of expression.1 We believe these \nprotections are essential. Intermediary liability protections \nhave enabled economic growth \nand access to information. We \nbelieve they are essential.\nDue diligence\nApart from an intermediary liability regime, \ncontent regulation may include due diligence \nobligations to foster greater transparency \nand accountability. Due diligence obligations \nshould be proportionate and risk-based, \nand focus on the systems and processes of \ncontent moderation over individual content \ndecisions. Rules should be adjusted based \non the relevant differences between types \nof services. What makes sense for content-\nsharing platforms may not be appropriate \nor technically feasible for a platform that \nhosts mobile apps or for a search engine. \nObligations should contain robust  \nsafeguards for human rights.\nOversight\nIf regulators oversee compliance w", "regulations_count": 22}
